- Static Code Analyzer, analyzes your code, to find anomalies. Currently only limited to "Insecure Functions" in your code!
- It doesn't stop there - as a precautionary measure, it provides you with safer function as an alternative - like instead of using `strcpy()` which is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow, it provides you with safer function as an alternative like `lstrcy()`, which is not vulnerable to Buffer Overflow, that you can implement on your code, to make it secure

# How is it different?
- Secode is powered by a **stringent and comprehensive ruleset**, that can detect vulnerabilities pretty easily, which will be updated regularly, 
as more vulnerabilities and exploits emerge
- Secode enforces the concept of "**Secure Coding" and "Secure Software Development Life Cycle (Secure SDLC)"** which is now gaining much needed traction during the development process of any software


# What does a Secode Scan On The Code You Provide?
Your Code Report provides you information about -

- Hit count of vulnerable functions (total count)
- Vulnerability at hand
- CWE Number associated with it
- A brief description about the vulnerability
- Risk level of your code (graded from 1 - 5, on the severity basis)
- Secure alternative(s) that you must use which are totally safe from exploits


## Installation Guide
Refer to the [Installation](INSTALL.md) file for an in-depth walkthrough on how to install the tool, on your Linux distribution


# Under the hood
- More technically, Secode uses [Lexical Scanning/ Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) to find tokens (such as function names) that suggest likely vulnerabilities, estimates their level of risk (e.g., by the text of function calls), and reports the results
- Secode does not use or have access to information about control flow, data flow, or data types
- Thus, secode will necessarily produce many false positives for vulnerabilities and fail to report many vulnerabilities
- On the other hand, secode can find vulnerabilities in programs that cannot be built or cannot be linked
- Secode also doesn't get as confused by macro definitions and other oddities that more sophisticated tools have trouble with


## Roadmap
- Dockerize it to provide support across all platforms
- Extending Scanning functionalities within the tool to: 
    1. Web Technologies like HTML, CSS, Js and PHP
    2. App Development languages like Java and Kotlin
- GitHub Actions workflows Integration
